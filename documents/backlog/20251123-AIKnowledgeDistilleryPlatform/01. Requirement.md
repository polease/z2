# 01. Requirement - Z AI Knowledge Distillery Platform

## Project Overview
Building an AI Knowledge Distillery Platform that delivers important AI knowledge from global sources (primarily YouTube) to Chinese audiences through automated curation, translation, and distribution.

## Current Vision Document Analysis
Based on the existing vision.md, the platform aims to:
- Monitor top AI YouTube channels and content
- Automatically identify high-quality content using multiple signals
- Process, translate, and curate content
- Distribute to Chinese platforms (WeChat, Bilibili, Douyin, etc.)
- Build a knowledge graph and community

## Requirements Clarification - Answered

### 1. **Scope & Priority** ✓
- **Decision**: MVP first approach
- **Starting Point**: New project from scratch
- **Priority**: Core processing pipeline before automation features

### 2. **Content Selection & Quality** ✓
- **Initial Approach**: Manual link input (user provides YouTube links)
- **Content Focus**: AI-related topics
- **Source Language**: English (primary)
- **Note**: Automated channel monitoring deferred to post-MVP

### 3. **Processing Pipeline** ✓
- **Subtitle Handling**:
  - If YouTube has subtitles → Use existing subtitles
  - If no subtitles → Use local Whisper for transcription
- **Translation**: OpenAI model for English to Chinese translation
- **Volume**: TBD (start with manual processing)
- **Storage**: TBD
- **Video Editing**: TBD

### 4. **Distribution Strategy** ✓
- **Platform Priority**: WeChat Video Channel and Bilibili
- **Automation Level**: Automated publishing to both platforms
- **Publishing Frequency**: TBD (based on processing volume)

### 5. **Technical Infrastructure** ✓
- **Video Storage**: Keep downloaded videos (permanent storage)
- **Output Format**: JSON for metadata and transcripts
- **Deployment**: TBD
- **Budget**: TBD

### 6. **Knowledge Graph & Community**
- **Scope**: Deferred to post-MVP

### 7. **Monetization & Business Model**
- **Scope**: Deferred to post-MVP

### 8. **Compliance & Legal**
- **Approach**: TBD

## MVP Scope Definition

### Core Features (Must Have)
1. **YouTube Video Input**
   - Accept YouTube video URL as input
   - Download video and metadata
   - Store video permanently

2. **Subtitle/Transcription Processing**
   - Check for existing YouTube subtitles
   - If available: extract and use YouTube subtitles
   - If not available: use local Whisper for transcription
   - Output: English transcript text

3. **Translation**
   - Use OpenAI API to translate English transcript to Chinese
   - Output: Chinese transcript text

4. **Summary & Insights Generation**
   - Use AI to generate content summary
   - Extract key insights and highlights
   - Output in Chinese

5. **Output & Storage**
   - Store all data in JSON format:
     - Original English transcript
     - Chinese translation
     - AI-generated summary and insights
     - Video metadata (title, channel, date, URL, etc.)
   - Keep downloaded videos in storage

6. **Multi-Platform Publishing**
   - Publish to WeChat Video Channel
   - Publish to Bilibili
   - Include translated content and summaries

### Out of Scope for MVP
- Automated channel monitoring
- Quality signal detection (view velocity, engagement, etc.)
- Automated video editing (deferred to later phase)
- Knowledge graph
- Community features
- Website/frontend
- Additional platforms (Douyin, Kuaishou)

## Requirements Summary

### What We're Building (MVP)
A pipeline that:
1. Takes a YouTube video URL
2. Downloads the video and keeps it
3. Extracts subtitles (YouTube native) or transcribes (Whisper)
4. Translates to Chinese (OpenAI)
5. Generates AI summaries and insights
6. Stores everything in JSON format
7. Publishes to WeChat Video Channel and Bilibili

### Technology Stack (Initial)
- **Video Download**: yt-dlp or similar
- **Transcription**: Whisper (local)
- **Translation**: OpenAI API
- **Summary/Insights**: OpenAI API (GPT-4 or similar)
- **Storage**: File system (JSON + video files)
- **Publishing**: WeChat API + Bilibili API

### Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)
- Automated channel monitoring
- Quality signal detection
- Video editing and highlight generation
- Knowledge graph
- Additional platforms (Douyin, Kuaishou)
- Website and community features

## Next Steps
✓ Requirements complete - Ready to proceed to design phase
